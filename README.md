===============

Def: Unsui (Japanese: 雲水), or kōun ryūsui (行雲流水) in full, 
is a term specific to Zen Buddhism which denotes a postulant awaiting acceptance into a monastery 
or a novice monk who has undertaken Zen training. 
Sometimes they will travel from monastery to monastery (angya) 
on a pilgrimage to find the appropriate Zen master to study with.


The term unsui, which literally translates as "cloud, water" comes from a Chinese poem which reads, 
"To drift like clouds and flow like water." Helen J. Baroni writes, 
"The term can be applied more broadly for any practitioner of Zen, 
since followers of Zen attempt to move freely through life, without the constraints and limitations of attachment, 
like free-floating clouds or flowing water.
